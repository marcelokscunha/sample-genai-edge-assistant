# Instructions for deployment

## If you plan to use AWS Amplify for frontend hosting

First follow the [frontend instructions](./visual_assistant_js/README.md) to deploy the web-app to Amplify. Once the application is deployed, populate the infrastructure by following [backend instructions](./backend/README.md) file. You need to create the Amplify application before as it will be modified by the backend deployment. **The first build of the Amplify application might faill because it awaits for backend deployment.**

## If your frontend runs on your local machine or a web server

This is the way to go if you do not want the frontend to be hosted on Amplify.
First follow the [backend instructions](./backend/README.md) file to deploy backend resources. Once they are properly deployed, follow the [frontend instructions](./visual_assistant_js/README.md) to deploy the web-app to your machine.
